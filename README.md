# 🦀 rrelayer 🦀

Note rrelayer is brand new and actively underdevelopment, things will change and bugs will exist—if you find any bugs or have any
feature requests, please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/joshstevens19/rrelayer/issues). 

rrelayer is an opensource powerful, high-performance blockchain transaction relay service built in Rust, designed for seamless integration with any EVM-compatible network.
This tool transforms complex blockchain interactions into simple REST API calls, eliminating the need for applications to manage wallets, transaction queuing, or nonce management.
For rrelayer supports advanced wallet infrastructure supporting multiple signing providers including AWS KMS hardware security modules,
Turnkey self-custody solutions, Fireblocks enterprise MPC custody, Privy managed wallets, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, PKCS#11 hardware security modules, and raw mnemonic development setups.
It's highly scalable and production-ready, enabling you to build robust Web3 applications with reliability and focus exclusively on your business logic.
rrelayer has some super cool out-of-the-box features, like automatic top-ups (with safe support), permissions config including allowlists, API keys with restricted access,
webhooks, rate limiting, and the ability to configure the gas bump blocks.

## Install

```bash
curl -L https://rrelayer.xyz/install.sh | bash
```

If you’re on Windows, you will need to install and use Git BASH or WSL, as your terminal,
since rrelayer installation does not support Powershell or Cmd.

## Use rrelayer

Once installed you can run `rrelayer --help` in your terminal to see all the commands available to you.

## Features

- Config Driven: Define everything in a simple rrelayer.yaml file, making it easy to turn on and off features
- Multi-Chain Support: Supports all EVM networks
- Transaction Relaying: Submit transactions to supported blockchain networks efficiently.
- Transaction Signing: Securely sign transactions using many of the signing providers.
- Transaction Fee Estimation: Estimate transaction fees for better cost management.
- Transaction Nonce Management: Handle nonce management to ensure transaction order.
- Transaction Status Monitoring: Track the status of submitted transactions.
- Transaction/Signing History: See all the transactions signed by the relayer or messages signed with a deep audit log
- SDK Integration: Integrate easily with our JS/TS API or rust API or
- Exposed API: If the SDK is not supported, you can just hit the API directly
- Extensible Architecture: Easily add support for new blockchain networks with a config update.
- Configurable Network Policies: Define and enforce network-specific policies for transaction processing.
- Automated top-ups: Build in background tasks to automatically top up relayers when gas or token funds are becoming low, with safe proxy support.
- Permissions: Add contract/addresses allowlists to relayers and turn on and off if they can sign messages, typed data, send transactions, and send native ETH.
- API Keys: Built-in API keys for relayers to allow you to give access to a system without giving access to every part of the rrelayer
- Webhooks: Notifications built in get notified of the transaction's status every step of the way or if balances are low.
- Rate Limiting: Built-in rate limiting allowing you to rate limit user transactions allowance by just updating the rrelayer.yaml
- Cron Jobs: Schedule recurring contract calls or raw calldata transactions from rrelayer.yaml.
- Flexibility: No hard constraints on features like you can config how often it bumps gas depending on your need. Maybe a liquidation bot may want to bump every block for example.
- CLI: rrelayer is CLI first, so you can do everything with the command line tool.
- Full transactions support: rrelayer can send blob transactions and any kind of EVM transaction.

## Downstream request policies

The Usher downstream release can add source-IP and Appsmith JWT checks to a
network permission entry. These checks are additional to basic/API-key
authorization: existing authorization runs first, then matching permission
entries are evaluated in configuration order. Within each entry the IP rule is
evaluated before JWT verification, and every matching entry must pass (AND
semantics).

```yaml
api_config:
  trust_forwarded_for: false
networks:
  - name: ethereum
    permissions:
      - relayers: "*"
        allowlist: []
        ip_allowlist:
          - 192.0.2.10/32
        request_verification:
          scheme: jwt_hs256
          params:
            secret_env: RRELAYER_REQUEST_SIGNATURE_KEY
            signature_header: x-appsmith-signature
```

Omitting either control preserves existing behavior. An explicitly empty
`ip_allowlist` denies every source. JWTs must be raw compact HS256 tokens (no
`Bearer` prefix), include `exp`, and remain unexpired with zero clock leeway.
The header defaults to `x-appsmith-signature`. Configuration validates IP rules,
header names, schemes, parameters, and the named non-empty secret before the
server starts; YAML contains the environment-variable name, never the secret.
If that secret disappears after startup, protected operations stop with a
sanitized HTTP 500 operator error and no mutation or signing is performed.

The policy protects direct/random transaction submission, replacement,
cancellation, message signing, typed-data signing, and both deprecated signing
aliases. It does not add checks to health, transaction reads/status/counts/history,
signing history, or relayer-management routes. Missing or invalid JWTs return
401. Unresolved or disallowed client IPs return 403. When both fail, IP-first
evaluation returns 403.

`trust_forwarded_for` defaults to false, which always uses the socket peer and
ignores spoofed forwarding headers. Enable it only behind an ingress that
overwrites client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For`. In trusted mode, an absent header
falls back to the peer, a malformed/non-ASCII header is unresolved, and only the
trimmed leftmost value of a multi-hop list is used.

Random submission orders available candidates by wallet index and then relayer
ID before policy evaluation. It selects only among passing candidates; if none
passes, it returns the first candidate's policy error in that stable order.

### Usage

To use rrelayer with Docker, you can run the CLI commands by mounting your project directory:

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/app/project ghcr.io/joshstevens19/rrelayer --help
```

### Creating a new project

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/app/project ghcr.io/joshstevens19/rrelayer new

## Helm Chart

Coming soon.

## Building

### Requirements

- Rust (latest stable)

### Locally

To build locally you can just run `cargo build` in the root of the project. This will build everything for you as this is a workspace.

**Note:** The first build may take longer.

Subsequent builds use smart caching and will only rebuild components that have changed.

### Prod

To build for prod you can run `make prod_build` this will build everything for you and optimise it for production.

## Formatting

you can run `cargo fmt` to format the code, rules have been mapped in the `rustfmt.toml` file.

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to rrelayer, feel free to look over the issues or open a new one if you have
any new ideas or bugs you have found.

### Playing around with the CLI locally

You can use the `make` commands to run the CLI commands locally, this is useful for testing and developing.
These are located in the `cli` folder > `Makefile`. It uses `CURDIR` to resolve the paths for you, so they should work
out of the box.

## Release

To release a new rrelayer:

1. Checkout `release/x.x.x` branch depending on the next version number
2. Push the branch to GitHub which will queue a build on the CI
3. Once build is successful, a PR will be automatically created with updated changelog and version
4. Review and merge the auto-generated PR - this will auto-deploy the release with binaries built from the release branch
